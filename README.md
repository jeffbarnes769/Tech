# It's not only about the Tech
Digital Transformation is not only about Tech - originally posted May 2017

There’s no single binary solution for Digital transformation.  It’s not an either/or but the blended adoption of various positions, and includes a significant technology component.  So while there’s much more to digital transformation than technology, the absence of certain tech guarantees failure.  Rather than “it’s not about the tech”, “it’s not only about the tech” increases the chance of success

True digital transformation requires significant changes to all three elements of the information systems triangle: strategy, organization and technology. Especially since every company is now, in some form,  a software company.
 
Strategically, organizations often start with the adoption of social channels, mobility and internal operational changes; and then begin to leverage cognitive capability and analytics, ‘platforms’ and the internet of things.
     
Organizational changes include a pivot from silos to outcomes, starting with two-speed or bimodal IT and a move from waterfall to agile  and beyond for service design and development (DevOps).   Internal process changes and responsibilities (architectural innovation) provide the complementary assets that support the pivot.  Organizationally, this fosters a culture of transformation.
 
Technically, by adopting DevOps digitally transformed organizations deploy applications regularly and at scale to meet demand, generally through continuous integration/continuous deployment.  This often requires orchestration and automation available via public, private or hybrid clouds and policy based networking.

Of course, this is a simplification that requires other components, such as exchanging data across different organizations or levels of government through API’s or other methods.  And exponential organizations often take advantage of network effects by leveraging platforms of both producers and consumers.
 
Some organizations implement digital transformation through the fire brigade method: creating a bimodal team to deploy (migrate) a specific workload or application.  If successful the organization then recursively apply the lessons to other processes and applications; similar to 18F.
 
Others implement required but challenging process and organizational changes, including digital identity, budget realignments, reduced silos, etc (such as GDS, DTO and others).  In reality, doing both at once seems to have the best chance of short and long-term success.
 
While digital transformation is much more than technology, true digital natives leverage technology differently and on a different scale than non-digital organizations.  The adoption of technology by itself does not foster digital transformation, however the absence of required technological components will certainly minimize its chances of success and outcomes.
